To exclude files that start with 'SOLAR Reporter' or 'SOLAR Tracker' and have extensions `.xlst`, `.xlsb`, or `.xlsm`, you can use the following regex pattern. This pattern matches files based on the specified criteria regardless of their directory:

```
scssCopy code
^(.*\/)?SOLAR (Reporter|Tracker).+\.(xlst|xlsb|xlsm)$
```

Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

* `^` asserts the start of the string.
* `(.*\/)?` is an optional group that matches any characters followed by a slash (`/`), representing the directory path. It's optional (`?`) to allow matching files in the root directory as well.
* `SOLAR (Reporter|Tracker)` matches strings starting with 'SOLAR Reporter' or 'SOLAR Tracker'.
* `.+` matches any characters (except newline), ensuring that there is at least one character between the 'SOLAR Reporter'/'SOLAR Tracker' prefix and the file extension.
* `\(xlst|xlsb|xlsm)` matches one of the specified file extensions.
* `$` asserts the end of the string.

### How to Add to `exclusions.txt`

To integrate this pattern into your `exclusions.txt` file, simply add a new line with the pattern:

```
scssCopy code
^(.*\/)?SOLAR (Reporter|Tracker).+\.(xlst|xlsb|xlsm)$
```

This will instruct your program to ignore files that meet these criteria, adding to the flexibility of your exclusion patterns and ensuring that specific files are automatically excluded based on their naming conventions and extensions.

What should my exclude epression be to exlude all archive types (.zip, .7z, .rar) under the path '/mnt/drive2/nextcloud/local-cache/Files/Consulting/08 Privacy Analytics PD\_2019\_11' Note that there are white spaces in the path.

To exclude all archive file types (`.zip`, `.7z`, `.rar`) under the specific path `/mnt/drive2/nextcloud/local-cache/Files/Consulting/08 Privacy Analytics PD_2019_11`, and considering there are spaces in the path, you will need to carefully craft a regex pattern that accurately matches this path and the file extensions. Here's how you can do it:

```
bashCopy code
^/mnt/drive2/nextcloud/local-cache/Files/Consulting/08 Privacy Analytics PD_2019_11/.+\.(zip|7z|rar)$
```

Here's the breakdown of this regex pattern:

* `^` asserts the start of the string.
* `/mnt/drive2/nextcloud/local-cache/Files/Consulting/08 Privacy Analytics PD_2019_11/` matches the specific directory path. Spaces are matched directly, as regex patterns can include spaces.
* `.+` matches any characters (except newline) that appear before the file extension. This ensures that the regex matches any file name.
* `\.(zip|7z|rar)` matches a literal period followed by one of the specified archive file extensions.
* `$` asserts the end of the string, ensuring that the matched string ends with one of the specified file extensions.

### Adding to `exclusions.txt`

To add this rule to your `exclusions.txt` file, simply include the pattern as a new line:

```
bashCopy code
^/mnt/drive2/nextcloud/local-cache/Files/Consulting/08 Privacy Analytics PD_2019_11/.+\.(zip|7z|rar)$
```

This pattern will instruct your program to ignore any files ending in `.zip`, `.7z`, or `.rar` that are located within the `/mnt/drive2/nextcloud/local-cache/Files/Consulting/08 Privacy Analytics PD_2019_11` directory, effectively excluding all archive files in that specific path from processing.

is this correct is I want to exclude all files under a certain path: ^/mnt/drive2/nextcloud/local-cache/Files/Consulting/08 Privacy Analytics PD\_2019\_11/1000-CTT-IT/.\*

ChatGPT

Yes, the regex pattern you've provided:

```
bashCopy code
^/mnt/drive2/nextcloud/local-cache/Files/Consulting/08 Privacy Analytics PD_2019_11/1000-CTT-IT/.*
```

is correctly formulated to match and exclude all files under the specific path `/mnt/drive2/nextcloud/local-cache/Files/Consulting/08 Privacy Analytics PD_2019_11/1000-CTT-IT/`. Here's a breakdown of the components of this regex pattern:

* `^` asserts the start of the string, ensuring that the path must begin with the specified directory structure.
* `/mnt/drive2/nextcloud/local-cache/Files/Consulting/08 Privacy Analytics PD_2019_11/1000-CTT-IT/` is the exact path you're targeting for exclusion. This part of the pattern precisely matches the directory path including the subdirectory `1000-CTT-IT`.
* `.*` matches any character (except for newline) zero or more times, covering all files and subdirectories under the specified path.

This pattern ensures that any file or directory within the `/mnt/drive2/nextcloud/local-cache/Files/Consulting/08 Privacy Analytics PD_2019_11/1000-CTT-IT/` directory will be excluded, as per the rules your program follows for handling exclusions based on the `exclusions.txt` file.
